    "- coders/software engineers spend as much time debugging and testing their codes as they spend on developing/writing the codes\n",
    "- \"To err is human, but to preserve in error is diabolic.\" - anonymous\n",
    "    - this more than two thousand-years old proverb fits with coding\n",
    "- \"Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence!\" - Edsger W. Dijkstra\n",
    "- code coverage is used to measure the degree to which the source code of a program is executed when a particular test suite runs\n",
    "- various coverage criteria:\n",
    "    - function coverage\n",
    "    - statement coverage\n",
    "    - branch coverage\n",
    "    - condition coverage\n",
    "    - loop coverage\n",
    "    - data-flow coverage\n",
    "    - function entry/exit coverage\n",
    "- full path coverage is usually impractical or impossible\n",
    "    - module with a succession of $n$ decision in it can have up to $2^n$ paths\n",
    "    - loops can result in an infinite number of paths"

    "    1. assert statements - natively supported in many languages; as we've used before\n",
    "    2. doctest - simple, interactive technique, but makes the source code look messy, as they're defined inside the same function and module\n",
    "    3. unit test - preferred; separates the code with test "

    "- to perform regression testing by verifying that interactive examples from a test file or a test object work as expected.\n",
    "- to write tutorial documentation for a package, liberally illustrated with input-output examples. Depending on whether the examples or the expository text are emphasized, this has the flavor of “literate testing” or “executable documentation”."
